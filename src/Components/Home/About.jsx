                <p>
                    On March 25th, 2024, I faced a situation that highlighted the critical need for reliable access to analysis resources.
                    As someone passionate about helping others with their model analysis, I had created a detailed video tutorial for a friend's CFD project. However, due to storage limitations, I had to delete the files.
                     A month later, the email expired, and when my friend needed the project guidelines again, they were gone.
                    She also asked for help interpreting the CFD results, which served as a reminder of how essential it is to have ongoing, easy access to accurate FEA and CFD tools and insights.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That experience inspired the creation of MeanAs, an AI-powered platform built to give you the clarity and confidence you need before and after any FEA or CFD project.
